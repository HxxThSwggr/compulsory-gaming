# Compulsory Gaming
A list of games significant enough to be played or at least taught in school.

## Goals
- Include history of gaming
- Come up with example games for each era and genres
- Deal with game ratings

## Out of scope (too lazy / uneducated to do)
- Figure out how much to actually force this and in what school grades (basically the education system part)
